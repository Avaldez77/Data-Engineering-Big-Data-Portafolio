# Big Data – General Topics Summary

This collection of exercises focuses on **Big Data concepts**, emphasizing how large-scale datasets are processed, transformed, and managed when data volume, velocity, or complexity exceed traditional processing limits. The projects simulate real-world scenarios where distributed systems are required to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance.

The objective is to demonstrate **practical large-scale data handling**, not theoretical or toy examples.

## Core Themes

The core themes across these exercises include:

- High-volume data ingestion  
- Distributed and parallel data processing  
- Batch-oriented large-scale workflows  
- Performance-aware data transformations  
- Scalable and fault-tolerant data pipelines  

The emphasis is on **scaling data processing**, not small or local data manipulation.

## Exploratory Large-Scale Data Processing

These exercises begin with **exploratory large-scale data processing**, focused on understanding data distribution, partitioning, and system constraints before applying transformations.

Key aspects include:
- Inspection of dataset size, partitions, and schema distribution  
- Identification of skew, imbalance, and data concentration issues  
- Initial performance and throughput observations  
- Assessment of processing and storage constraints  

This step ensures that transformations are **designed with scale in mind**.

## Distributed Data Transformation & Computation

This set of exercises centers on **distributed transformation logic executed across multiple nodes**.

Key components include:
- Parallel filtering, aggregation, and summarization  
- Grouping and joins over large datasets  
- Optimization of execution paths and resource usage  
- Minimization of data shuffling and redundant computation  
- Awareness of memory and execution constraints  

The focus is on **efficiency, correctness, and scalability**.

## Data Organization & Structure at Scale

Several exercises address **how large datasets should be structured and organized** to support scalable processing.

They focus on:
- Logical organization of raw, intermediate, and processed data  
- Partitioning strategies and data layout considerations  
- Preparation of datasets for analytical or downstream consumption  
- Structuring outputs suitable for analytics, BI, or ML pipelines  

This demonstrates understanding of **data layout as a critical performance factor**.

## Methodological Principles

Across all exercises, consistent methodological principles are applied:

- Scalability-first design decisions  
- Deterministic and repeatable distributed workflows  
- Explicit consideration of system and resource constraints  
- Validation of results despite distributed execution  
- Preference for clarity and robustness over unnecessary complexity  

The methodology reflects **production-oriented Big Data thinking**, not academic experimentation.

## Practical Relevance

These exercises are designed to mirror **real Big Data scenarios**, such as:

- Processing large transactional or log-based datasets  
- Supporting data-intensive analytical workloads  
- Preparing scalable datasets for reporting or modeling  
- Enabling downstream analytics and decision-making at scale  

The outputs are structured to be **directly consumable by analytics, data science, or BI teams** operating in high-volume environments.

**Overall**, this body of work demonstrates foundational **Big Data competence**, showing the ability to process, transform, and organize large datasets using scalable and distributed data processing approaches.
