🔍 Overview
This project delivers a concise market basket analysis pipeline that transforms raw transactional data into actionable product-level insights. It focuses on data cleaning, frequency analysis, and association patterns to support basic merchandising and inventory decisions through dashboard-ready outputs.

🎯 Objective
To build a lightweight yet structured data workflow that identifies the most frequently purchased products and common item combinations, enabling quick insight into customer buying behavior.

🧠 Methodology
Raw transaction records were ingested from CSV files and cleaned using Python to remove duplicates, normalize product names, and handle missing values. Cleaned data was organized into analytics-ready tables, and SQL was used to compute product frequencies and basic association metrics suitable for visualization.

📊 Key Results
- Cleaned and standardized transaction dataset
- Identification of top-selling products across all transactions
- Detection of frequently co-purchased item pairs
- Gold-level summary tables optimized for dashboard consumption
- Visual representation of purchase patterns and product popularity

🛠 Technologies & Skills
- Python (pandas for data cleaning and preparation)
- SQL (aggregation and frequency analysis)
- CSV-based data modeling
- Basic analytical data pipeline design
- Dashboard-oriented metric generation
