# SQL Patterns: HAVING, Subqueries & Surrogate Keys

🔍 Overview\
This project focuses on advanced SQL patterns used in operational
analytics, especially when working with repeated identifiers and
line-level data.

🎯 Objective\
Highlight mastery of HAVING clauses, subqueries, enrichment, and
operational risk segmentation using SQL.

🧠 Methodology\
- Modeled delivery data with repeated DO numbers at line level.\
- Aggregated data at multiple granularities (line, DO, lane).\
- Applied HAVING filters to identify complex operational cohorts.\
- Enriched data with carrier and service-level attributes.\
- Built rule-based risk segmentation.

📊 Key Results\
- Identification of dense and high-risk delivery lanes.\
- Carrier performance comparison by volume, weight, and DG exposure.\
- Detection of anomalous delivery lines.

🛠 Technologies & Skills\
- SQL (HAVING, subqueries, CASE logic)\
- Operational analytics\
- Python (SQLite, pandas, matplotlib)

🧩 Why This Project Matters\
It reflects real logistics and operations analytics problems, where SQL
must handle messy, repeated identifiers and risk detection.
