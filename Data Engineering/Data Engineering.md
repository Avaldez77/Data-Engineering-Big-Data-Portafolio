# Data Engineering – General Topics Summary

This collection of exercises focuses on **core Data Engineering concepts**, emphasizing how raw data is ingested, transformed, structured, and prepared for analytical and downstream use. The projects are designed to simulate real-world data workflows, combining data processing, transformation logic, and validation steps commonly found in production environments.

The objective is to demonstrate **practical data handling skills**, not isolated scripts.

## Core Themes

The core themes across these exercises include:

- Structured and semi-structured data ingestion  
- Data cleaning, normalization, and validation  
- Transformation logic for analytical readiness  
- Aggregation and enrichment of datasets  
- Reproducible and scalable data workflows  

The emphasis is on **reliable data pipelines**, not ad-hoc analysis.

## Exploratory Data Processing

These exercises start with **exploratory data processing**, focused on understanding the structure and quality of incoming data before transformation.

Key aspects include:
- Inspection of schemas, data types, and null values  
- Detection of inconsistencies, duplicates, and malformed records  
- Initial profiling of distributions and key metrics  
- Identification of transformation requirements  

This step ensures that downstream transformations are **data-driven and defensible**.

## Data Transformation & Pipeline Logic

This set of exercises centers on **transforming raw data into structured, analysis-ready formats**.

Key components include:
- Column standardization and type casting  
- Row-level transformations and conditional logic  
- Aggregations, joins, and derived metrics  
- Grouping logic based on business or temporal rules  
- Handling repeated records and cumulative calculations  

The focus is on **correctness, consistency, and traceability** of transformations.

## Data Modeling & Structure

Several exercises address **how transformed data should be structured** for analytical or reporting use.

They focus on:
- Logical data modeling for downstream consumption  
- Creation of clean, well-defined tables or datasets  
- Separation between raw, intermediate, and final outputs  
- Preparation of datasets suitable for dashboards or ML pipelines  

This demonstrates awareness of **data lifecycle and data layering principles**.

## Methodological Principles

Across all exercises, consistent methodological principles are applied:

- Deterministic and repeatable transformations  
- Clear separation between ingestion, processing, and output  
- Explicit handling of edge cases and data anomalies  
- Validation of results through sanity checks  
- Preference for clarity and robustness over clever shortcuts  

The methodology reflects **production-oriented thinking**, not academic experimentation.

## Practical Relevance

These exercises are designed to mirror **real Data Engineering scenarios**, such as:

- Preparing operational data for analytics  
- Cleaning and aggregating transactional datasets  
- Building intermediate datasets for reporting teams  
- Supporting reliable metrics and KPIs  

The outputs are structured to be **directly consumable by analysts, data scientists, or BI tools**.

**Overall**, this body of work demonstrates foundational **Data Engineering competence**, showing the ability to take imperfect raw data and convert it into structured, reliable datasets through well-defined transformation pipelines.
