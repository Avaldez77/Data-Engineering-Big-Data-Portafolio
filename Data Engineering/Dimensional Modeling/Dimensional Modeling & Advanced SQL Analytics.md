# Advanced SQL Modeling & Analytics

🔍 Overview\
This project applies dimensional modeling concepts to analyze sales
performance using fact and dimension tables. It emphasizes analytical
SQL patterns common in enterprise analytics.

🎯 Objective\
Demonstrate advanced SQL analytics on star-schema data, including trend
analysis, customer concentration, and integrity validation.

🧠 Methodology\
- Built a fact table linked to multiple dimensions (date, product,
customer).\
- Used window functions and CTEs for trend and cohort analysis.\
- Validated referential integrity across all dimensions.\
- Measured revenue concentration and dependency on top customers.

📊 Key Results\
- Weekly revenue trends with seasonality signals.\
- Quantified revenue concentration risk (Top 5 / Top 10 customers).\
- Verified dimensional consistency across the model.

🛠 Technologies & Skills\
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, analytical aggregates)\
- Dimensional modeling\
- Python, SQLite\
- Business performance analytics

🧩 Why This Project Matters\
It mirrors real enterprise BI workloads and demonstrates readiness for
analytics roles working with warehouse-style data models.
