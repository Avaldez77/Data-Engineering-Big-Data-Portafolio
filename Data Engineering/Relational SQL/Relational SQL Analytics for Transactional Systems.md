# SQL Fundamentals -- Relational Analysis

🔍 Overview\
This project demonstrates core SQL analytics applied to a transactional
relational model. It focuses on transforming raw order-line data into
meaningful business indicators through aggregation, joins, and
constraints.

🎯 Objective\
Showcase solid command of SQL fundamentals for analytics: grouping,
joins, constraints, KPIs, and validation queries used in real-world data
workflows.

🧠 Methodology\
- Designed a normalized relational schema (customers, orders,
order_items, products).\
- Executed aggregation queries to compute revenue, AOV, unit volume, and
order mix.\
- Applied integrity checks and constraint validation to ensure data
reliability.\
- Used exploratory queries to profile distributions and detect
anomalies.

📊 Key Results\
- Clear revenue and order behavior by status and category.\
- Identification of high-impact customers and products.\
- Validation that schema constraints prevent inconsistent or invalid
data.

🛠 Technologies & Skills\
- SQL (GROUP BY, JOINs, constraints)\
- SQLite\
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)\
- Data modeling and KPI design

🧩 Why This Project Matters\
It proves the ability to move from raw relational data to decision-ready
metrics---an essential skill for analytics, BI, and data engineering
roles.
