# Nested SQL & Relational Analysis

🔍 Overview\
This project applies nested queries and window functions to analyze
relational media data, focusing on ranking, grouping, and network-style
signals.

🎯 Objective\
Show advanced SQL reasoning using nested logic and ranking across
hierarchical dimensions.

🧠 Methodology\
- Used window functions to rank entities within groups.\
- Applied nested queries for multi-level aggregation.\
- Built composite metrics to evaluate reach and influence.

📊 Key Results\
- Top‑N rankings per group with deterministic ordering.\
- Actor-level reach scores combining volume and quality.\
- Clear demonstration of hierarchical SQL logic.

🛠 Technologies & Skills\
- SQL (window functions, nested queries)\
- Relational reasoning\
- Python and SQLite

🧩 Why This Project Matters\
It proves fluency in complex SQL logic required for analytical querying,
ranking systems, and feature engineering.
